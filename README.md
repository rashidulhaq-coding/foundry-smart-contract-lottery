# Provably Random Raffle Contract

## About This Project

This code is to create a provably random smart contract lottery.

## what we want it to do?

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket.
    1. The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw.
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
    1. And this will be done programatically.
3. Using Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Automation
    1. Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
    2. Chainlink automation -> Time based trigger
